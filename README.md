# What is this?

A host file sourced from https://github.com/googlehosts/hosts/, but clean of copyright.

# But why?

Because I am a terrible person who doesn't like [their weird non-free LICENSE](https://github.com/googlehosts/hosts/blob/master/LICENSE) and [using DDoS as a threatening tactic](https://github.com/googlehosts/hosts/issues/279). Note that hosts file is basically a collection of _factual information_, which has nothing to do with creativity.

The US Supreme Court ruled in _Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service_ that mere collections of facts are considered unoriginal and thus not protected by copyright, so that nobody is entitled to gain a monopoly over facts. The arrangement and presentation of a collection may be original, but not if it is "simple and obvious" such as a list in alphabetical or chronological order.

This 'folk' eliminates any potential creative arrangement by re-sorting domains alphabetically, and as a result copyright does not apply. It is a valid method in many countries, but European users should have a chat with their MEPs.

# You are pissing off upstream!

I acknowledge the upstream's effort to assemble the information. This is only a proof of concept to workaround weird licensing terms like "maintain the fork on the same platform". I still recommend you to give them appropriate credits should you benefit from their work, just out of morality. I do not intend to update it regularly enough to compete with upstream.

While I in good faith believe this repo does not infringe the upstream's copyright, I will not file a counter-notice if they are bothered so much that they decide to take down the repo, although they may have to commit a perjury in order to claim so.
